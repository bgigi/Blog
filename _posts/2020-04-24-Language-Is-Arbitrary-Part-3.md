## Dear Baby Girl,

<p>Now let's talk about bad language. I believe bad language in the logical sense is ineffective language. Sure many people would claim that swearing is bad language and, to an extent, it can be. When someone has hot words, they have increased the barrier to communication. I think a person who creates artificial hindrances to discussion is being foolish.  Effectively communicating is already hard enough.  Having to dance around peoples personal pet peeves because they are an easily offended snowflake significantly increases the friction between the exchange of words.  This is import because of the meaning of the old saying, 'When goods can't cross borders troops will.'  This concept holds for communicating 'When words stop flowing fist start flying.'</p>

<p>Take a swear word, for example. The word we will use is 'FUCK' because it will apply to the next point as well. The word itself is just a grouping of letters. None of the letters f, u, c, k are themselves bad. However, the claim is that the combination itself is terrible. This is nonsense. The badness can't be in the word. Yet those who get hung up on the word will be perfectly fine accepting the concept being described so long as the word itself is not used. This is what I mean when I say it is foolishness to get hung up on bad words. To close down communication simply because you don't like the letter arrangement used is foolish short-sidedness at best. There is no such thing as a bad word. But if someone claims there is, then that means they have foolishly raised language barriers for themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, people will have their justification for why they think it is a bad word, and others will say it is offensive as the concept. Some will just claim the topic is not necessarily offensive, but the person using the term is juvenile and, therefore, not worth talking to or a whole host of justification to close the lines of communication. I think it is a failure if someone closes down dialogue due to a trigger or hot word for whatever word it may be. The words being used should not be the point of importance. The important part is to get the concept across. Putting artificial limits on language use increases the difficulty of success.</p> 

<p>That said, it is also short-sided to use words you know to be a hot word that many people will close down the lines of communication over. Or they may waste your time with a lecture on how you should not say certain words and how you should limit yourself unnecessarily.  Unfortunately, many people have decided that people should easily take offense to other peoples words.</p>

<p>This brings to the related point of offensive words. Once again, how is an arrangement of letters offensive? Well, it isn't always the word itself that is considered offensive.  Many times it is the concept it embodies that is deemed to be offensive. The word 'FUCK' we used above is considered by many to be offensive. Well, no concept in the universe should be regarded as offensive. It may be used in a way to try and give someone offense by telling them to go $#%^ themselves. But the concept itself is not offensive. The concept is only a concept.</p>

<p>The argument that you are using language to psychology attack someone might be claimed as what is offensive. Though in this case, one need only remember that offense can only ever be offered. Whether or not you take it is your choice. However, many people will take offense at many different things failing to realize that it is their choice to take offense.  That doesn't mean you need to like someone. It means that you don't give them power over you.  A jerk is a jerk, but don't provide them with the ability to control you.</p>

<p>I do advise that you identify those offensive phrases and not use them. This will reduce the potential situation that someone's foolishness doesn't get in the way and close down the lines of communication. Doing this doesn't mean you acknowledge they are right. It means you don't want to waste your time with their foolishness.</p>

<p>Of course, you are free to use whatever language with me. When you do manage to offend me, be sure to remind me that the reason I got offended was of my choosing, and I should strive for tolerance. In doing so, you will learn the lesson of how futile it is to try and encourage someone to grow themselves after they have closed down the lines of communication and are pissed off. That said, I will appreciate the reminder that it is me being unreasonable by getting offended.</p>

<p>However, be warned as you go to school and forced to endure the authority of others over you.  You will run into unnecessary hardship if you do not communicate to them in the context they desire. There will be times you must tolerate very close-minded individuals.</p>
