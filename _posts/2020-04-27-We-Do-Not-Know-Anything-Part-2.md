## Dear Baby Girl,

<p>As you grow up and are sitting in class, you will be taught many things. Hopefully, those things will be valid science. Still, even science is just a speculation that is based on observation and measurements. It doesn't mean it is complete or right. Though the more accurate and correct measurements and observations, the more likely it is closer to the truth. However, as a spoiler, don't expect to get anything close to the truth out of your formalized education.  That isn't the goal of education.  It might be the goal of your endeavors to learn. Still, education, especially formalized ones and learning are not very related.</p>

<p>But as I said, assuming it is valid science. Most teachers at school are not an expert on what they teach. Some have no clue and just read out of a book, and sometimes they just make things up. They will sometimes provide misleading views on topics to encourage a specific belief, and this is especially true of institutions that are affiliated with some type of organization. Such as religious private schools teach subjects and massage facts that support that religion and government schools do the same to support the government institutions.  Just like religious school curriculums are not often critical of the organization that approves their curriculum. Government schools are not critical of the political body that approves their curriculum.</p>

<p>After all, they are human too, and they have their agendas and desires and personal failings and sometimes just make mistakes. But all of them are just as clueless as the rest of us. Even scientists are clueless, and good scientists know they are and are actively working to solve a small part of the great mystery of life. Anytime anyone claims something, be it a teacher, scientist, parent, or any 'authority,' know that it is just a data point.    It may be wrong, or it might be correct.  But realize sometimes you are intentionally given incorrect information to guide your behavior a certain way that is advantageous to their goals.  But exclusively trusting yourself is not always reasonable because even your observation and reasoning will, at times, prove to be incorrect.</p>

<p>Now, like I said, I don't know anything in the sense of actually knowing it. To give you an example of what I mean. Imagine what a dog is, not a specific dog but the traits that define a dog. If you were to write these traits out, you would find it impossible to describe the concept of a dog in such a way that all dogs and only dogs fit it.</p>

<p>The notion here is that a concept at its core can have infinite application. Yet, our mind works primarily as a finite entity, which makes sense given the matter our brains are composed of is finite.  This restriction creates an inherent limitation to our mental abilities. It doesn't mean we can't do abstract reasoning with concepts because we can. However, it does mean that we can never truly know a concept since we can never truly comprehend all of its infinite manifestations. As a word of caution, this is very sloppy reasoning I have given you. However, that doesn't mean there isn't a point in it.</p>

<p>Overall the best thing I can recommend is to keep an open mind, and as you work to build your world view, be sure to stay flexible and ready to redefine your world view. Sometimes it will be the simplest of things like a mutated flower that didn't follow what you knew to be right that causes your world view to shift. Whatever it is, don't be afraid of having your world view change. Instead, embrace that change as growth and evolution.</p> 

<p>Sure, you will be teased because you end up changing your beliefs over time. However, it is much better to have beliefs you challenge, define, reason out, and create as your own. It is far worse to have beliefs that were given to you from external authorities that you hold even though you know they don't make sense.</p>

<p>Be free to grow who and what you are.  As you do, try to understand the context of your reality, and how and where you fit into this grand universe.</p>

<p>I will end this with a little hint that took me most of my life to realize and sadly much too late. There is in you a very clouded, exceptionally hard to understand and reason about, general sense or instinct. Though it is not always right, it does act as a current compass of who you are. If you use your reason with this internal compass together, you will find your journey is a lot less painful and a lot more fulfilling.</p>
